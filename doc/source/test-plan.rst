Test Plan for XenServer Fuel Plugin
===================================

XenServer Fuel Plugin
=====================

XenServer Fuel Plugin will help to deploy Mirantis OpenStack using the
XenServer hypervisor to host virtual machines, making all the necessary
changes to the Mirantis OpenStack to use the xenapi Nova compute driver.


Developer’s Specification
=========================

See developers specification in the source code repository at
https://git.openstack.org/openstack/fuel-plugin-xenserver

Limitations
-----------

This version of XenServer Fuel Plugin has not been certified to work with the
Ceilometer, MongoDB or Murano additional services.  Future versions of the
plugin will relax these restrictions.


Test strategy
=============

Acceptance criteria
-------------------

All tests that do not depend on additional services must pass.

Test environment, infrastructure and tools
------------------------------------------

All tests need to be run under a cluster of at least 4 XenServer machines
with 3 physical NICs. As HA and multihost are enabled, a topology of 3
Controller Nodes + 3 Compute Nodes + 1 Storage Node will be recommended to be
created as VMs on XenServer machines. Easy setup and management of those
XenServers and VM Nodes can be achieved using XenCenter and a plugin,
described below, to add an internal management network to VMs.

To simplify setup, the fuel master is also installed on the XenServer hosts
(so XenServer hosts can fully control the network setup), but this is not
required.

While many networking setups are expected to work, the following setup is
used by this test plan:

* eth0 / “Access network”: Used to access the XenServer hosts and the Fuel
Master’s web interface
* eth1 / “Control network”: OpenStack control plane (management and storage),
the PXE network and the public network; all separated by VLAN tags.  The
public network is also on this network, and if a VLAN is required this is
applied by the switch for untagged traffic.
* eth2 / “VLAN network”: This version of the plugin only supports VLAN
segmentation for Neutron networking.  This device carries all of the VLANs to
be used by Neutron for VM traffic.

For the hardware configuration see Mirantis OpenStack Planning Guide at
https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-8.0/mos-planning-guide.html

Product compatibility matrix
----------------------------

The plugin is compatible with MOS 8.0 and XenServer 6.5 SP1, with all
hotfixes applied (Especially hotfix XS65ESP1013).


Prerequirements
===============

Prepare XenServers
------------------

#. Install and start XenCenter on your Windows PC
#. Add new servers with a common root password in XenCenter
#. Plug three physical NIC to each of all XenServer machines, make sure the
   cabling of all NIC 0 are attached to the ‘access’ network, all NIC 1 to the
   ‘public’ network  and NIC 2 are attached to the isolated, ‘VLAN network’.
   It is recommended to rename these networks using XenCenter to make the
   network topology clear.
#. Add a further network, with a vlan tag that will be used for PXE.

Prepare Fuel Master
-------------------

#. Upload Fuel ISO to a NFS/Samba server and make it accessible to your
   XenServer hosts.
#. Select a XenServer and click “New Storage” button, in the popup window
   check on CIFS/NFS ISO library and input NFS/Samba server path.
#. Create a new VM in XenCenter using the “Other Install Media” template (to
   ensure a HVM domain is created) with and PXE network as eth0 and ‘access’
   network as eth1. In the Console Tab, insert Fuel ISO and install.
#. In fuel menu, enable eth1 with DHCP so the fuel master can be accessed
   over the ‘access’ network.
#. Select Fuel Master in XenCenter and switch to Console tab, login with
   prompted user and password
#. Visit http://ip_of_fuel_master:8000 in browser.

       started.. Please refer to OpenStack logs for more details.”

Modifying env with enabled plugin (removing/adding controller nodes)
