#. Logging

   In addition to the Astute log, XenServer Fuel Plugin has its own log under
   /var/log/fuel-plugin-xenserver on all Compute and Controller nodes.

   Besides HIMN tool mentioned in Installation Guide also has its own log
   under ``%LOCALAPPDATA%/Temp/XCHIMN.log``.

   You can upload issued logs to https://cis.citrix.com or send to support if
   they are requested. `Writing Good Bug Reports for XenServer`_ might be a
   good reference to follow.
